# Production Efficiency and Cost Optimization Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an intelligent decision-support system for manufacturing production planning. The system will provide actionable insights on **which products should be produced and in what quantities** to maximize profitability, considering constraints and priorities related to production time and resource usage.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze historical production data to understand product-level time, cost, and resource consumption patterns.
- Build predictive models to estimate:
  - Production cycle time per unit
  - Resource usage per product (material, labor, energy)
  - Profitability metrics per product
- Incorporate user-defined priority sliders for:
  - **Time Priority**: Prioritize products with lower production time.
  - **Resource Priority**: Prioritize products with lower resource consumption.
- Develop an optimization framework to recommend product mix/production quantities that maximize profit under the given constraints and priorities.
- Provide insights to improve production efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**  
   Collect and preprocess production data including product details, production times, resource usage, costs, and outputs.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Extract relevant features like cycle times, tool usage durations, material consumption, labor hours, and downtime reasons.

3. **Model Development**  
   - Train regression models to predict production time, resource use, and profit per product unit.  
   - Define an optimization problem that incorporates predicted metrics and priority sliders.

4. **Optimization and Insights**  
   - Use linear programming to solve for optimal production quantities maximizing profit while respecting time and resource constraints.  
   - Allow tuning of production priorities via sliders affecting the optimization objective.

5. **Evaluation and Validation**  
   - Evaluate model accuracy and optimization results on historical data.  
   - Validate recommended production plans with business constraints.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python, Pandas, NumPy for data processing  
- Scikit-learn or similar for regression modeling  
- Optimization libraries: SciPy (linprog), PuLP, or CVXPY for linear programming  
- Jupyter / Google Colab as development environment  

---

## Expected Outcomes

- A flexible and interpretable model for production planning under multiple constraints.  
- Ability to simulate different priority scenarios (time vs resource) and see recommended production mixes.  
- Actionable insights for operations teams to improve efficiency and profitability.
